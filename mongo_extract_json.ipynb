       " 'text': 'A few things to add about the “owl attack.” This kind of thing is open to discussion and is mainly conjecture as to the cause, based on anecdotal evidence and association. I’ve seen or heard an adult Barred Owl close to 3,000 times from about 600 different territories during my research and have been hit or swooped on from Spring through Fall, all times of year, by different owls and in different places. I’ve heard and felt an owl zoom past my head in total dark, obviously maneuvering to miss, both amazing and also worrying in a problematic way, with any contact out of my control to prevent. The behavior is not exclusive to this time of year but may increase to some degree. An owl will also “attack” an inanimate object pulled along the ground by a fishing line. I’ve had owls “attack” my watch thinking it was a prey to be taken and swoop toward something thrown through the air.\\n\\nThis behavior may be heightened somewhat this time of year according to the factors Paul raises as well as some other possibilities. When the juveniles leave, the adults, having spent an entire summer feeding a family, suddenly have a lot of extra time to do things other than feed their young. The local cupboard may be getting a little bare, causing the owls to explore a wider area. It may be this extra time is used to revisit and renegotiate territorial boundaries. The dispersing juveniles need to learn where they can go and which areas are off limits, to them a total unknown. A territorial vocal adult is a good way to let juveniles know where they shouldn’t go. There is a lot of activity this time of year and it might put the territorial adults a little bit on edge.\\n\\nThere are also factors such as individual personality and mistaken interpretation. Some owls are naturally more aggressive or energetic than others and may explain why this happens in some places while not in others. Owls are opportunists and likely to pounce upon any opportunity that presents itself. Something about a person moving through a territory might suggest what appears to be a prey opportunity and it’s worthwhile for the owl to make mistakes if some of them result in a prize. Owls are very keen on movement and sound, not so much on exact identification, which is why they will not take a dead small mammal that makes no sound or has no movement, but will chase a ball of fiber at the end of a pulled string. If a person moving past an owl makes a sound that is suggestive of a prey opportunity, or has something that looks like prey, that may be enough to trigger action. If the person running had a headlamp snatched, it seems possible it was mistaken for prey, or there may have been something else suggestive and the headlamp was incidental. A territorial action is possible and would make sense if many people were getting hit or swooped by the same owl. It could be a combination of any of these factors.\\n\\nI’m not a supporter of the hormone idea based on similar time frames for light because different owl species nest at different times but all have this increased Fall activity at the same time. The Fall behavior is not staggered in time according to species as far as I can tell.\\n\\nA possibility to prevent contact would be to change apparel, hair, or anything obvious like a headlamp, and see what happens. Or simply go somewhere else, as was suggested, since owl talons are extremely sharp and strong, eyes are obviously vulnerable, and contact is usually not anticipated before it happens. As to the reasons why this might happen, it would need some structured experimentation to bring it out of the realm of conjecture.\\n\\nBob Pearson\\nPackwood, WA\\n\\n\\nDate: Sun, 17 Sep 2017 10:50:24 -0700\\nFrom: Paul Bannick <paul.bannick at gmail.com>\\nSubject: Re: [Tweeters] Owl Attack\\nTo: Steve Loitz <steveloitz at gmail.com>\\nCc: TWEETERS <tweeters at u.washington.edu>\\nMessage-ID:\\n<CAAb_2hjh+8mvhdofsLdeQqunJNEhVmBX2FBpLwFCQpWVagNF7Q at mail.gmail.com>\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"utf-8\"\\n\\nHi Tweets,\\n\\nJamie Acker and I had have discussed these \"encounters\" at length. I prefer\\nnot use the work \"attack\" as most of the these encounters are brief bumps\\non the head, although sometimes talons are extended.\\n\\nThese encounters happen when many large owls are on the move and are more\\nlikely to encounter one another. It is also possible that the length of\\nthe day at this time of the year (the photo-period is the same as it is\\nduring spring breeding) may trigger hormones and make the owls more\\naggressive and reactive.\\n\\nIn the fall and early winter young owls are dispersing from their natal\\nterritories, and adult owls are moving beyond boundaries of the nesting\\nterritories as they utilize more of their home ranges. These things are\\nhappening at the same time with Barred Owls and Great Horned Owls, making\\nowl encounters between large owls more likely. The adults that occupy the\\nterritory, perhaps the males in particular, are more focused on enforcing\\nboundaries, resulting in encounters among owls and between owls and large\\nanimals, including humans.\\n\\nThe best advice as Christina suggested is to avoid those areas as this time\\nof the year or heed the owl warning and move on.\\n\\nPaul\\n\\n\\nOn Fri, Sep 15, 2017 at 12:40 PM, Steve Loitz <steveloitz at gmail.com> wrote:\\n\\n\\n> In the past 25 years of running trails at Tiger Mtn., several individuals\\n\\n> in my party have been bonked in the head by Barred Owls.
