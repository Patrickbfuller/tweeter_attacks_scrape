       " 'text': 'Hi Tweets,\\n\\nJamie Acker and I had have discussed these \"encounters\" at length. I prefer\\nnot use the work \"attack\" as most of the these encounters are brief bumps\\non the head, although sometimes talons are extended.\\n\\nThese encounters happen when many large owls are on the move and are more\\nlikely to encounter one another. It is also possible that the length of\\nthe day at this time of the year (the photo-period is the same as it is\\nduring spring breeding) may trigger hormones and make the owls more\\naggressive and reactive.\\n\\nIn the fall and early winter young owls are dispersing from their natal\\nterritories, and adult owls are moving beyond boundaries of the nesting\\nterritories as they utilize more of their home ranges. These things are\\nhappening at the same time with Barred Owls and Great Horned Owls, making\\nowl encounters between large owls more likely. The adults that occupy the\\nterritory, perhaps the males in particular, are more focused on enforcing\\nboundaries, resulting in encounters among owls and between owls and large\\nanimals, including humans.\\n\\nThe best advice as Christina suggested is to avoid those areas as this time\\nof the year or heed the owl warning and move on.\\n\\nPaul\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Fri, Sep 15, 2017 at 12:40 PM, Steve Loitz <steveloitz at gmail.com> wrote:\\n\\n\\n> In the past 25 years of running trails at Tiger Mtn., several individuals\\n\\n> in my party have been bonked in the head by Barred Owls.
